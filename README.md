A comprehensive forum scraper for the Hexus Forums using Bun and TypeScript. Features pagination support, rate limiting, and a CLI viewer for browsing scraped content. This project also includes functionality to convert images to ASCII art.

## Features ✨

* Full forum scraping with pagination support
* Rate limiting and retry mechanisms
* Progress tracking and statistics
* SQLite database storage
* Minitel-inspired interactive CLI viewer with ASCII art support
* Error handling and recovery
* Configurable scraping parameters
* Image to ASCII art conversion

## Setup 🛠️

### Using the Dev Container (Recommended)

For the easiest and most consistent development experience, we highly recommend using the provided Dev Container. This will automatically set up a pre-configured environment with all the necessary tools and dependencies.

1. Install Docker and the VS Code Remote - Containers extension
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. When prompted, choose "Reopen in Container" - VS Code will build the container and connect to it

**Dev Container Benefits:**

* **Consistent Environment:** Ensures everyone is using the same versions of Node.js, Bun, and other tools
* **Pre-installed Dependencies:** All required dependencies are already installed within the container
* **Simplified Setup:** No need to manually install Bun, Node.js, or other tools on your local machine
* **Integrated Terminal:** The default terminal in the Dev Container is `fish`, a user-friendly shell
* **Helpful Shortcuts:**
  * `scrape`: Runs the scraper (`bun run scrape`)
  * `browse`: Runs the CLI viewer (`bun run browse`)
  * `dbreset`: Resets the database (`bun run db:reset`)
  * `help`: Displays help for the shell

### Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use the Dev Container, you can set up the project manually:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/milesburton/hexus-forum-scraper.git
   ```
   **Important**: Ensure the project is in your WSL2 filesystem (e.g., `/home/<your_username>/`)

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your configuration (see Configuration section below)

## Usage 📋

### Scraping the Forum ⚙️

Run the scraper:
```bash
bun run scrape
```

The scraper will:
* Create/reset the database if requested
* Scrape all subforums
* Follow pagination for threads and posts
* Display progress statistics
* Handle errors gracefully

### Browsing Scraped Data 🖥️

Launch the CLI viewer:
```bash
bun run browse
```

Features:
* Browse subforums, threads, and posts with a Minitel-inspired interface
* Pagination support for large content
* Easy keyboard-based navigation
* Real-time statistics display
* ASCII art conversion for images
* Thread and subforum hierarchy visualization

Here's how it looks in action:
